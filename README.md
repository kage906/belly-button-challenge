# Introduction:
In this project, I built an interactive dashboard using D3 library to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset revealed that a small handful of microbial species, also called operational taxonomic units (OTUs), were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# Project Overview:
The goal of the project is to create an interactive dashboard that displays the top 10 OTUs found in an individual's belly button, a bubble chart that displays each sample, and the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

# What I Did:
I used D3 library to read in samples.json, created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in an individual, created a bubble chart that displays each sample, and displayed the sample metadata.

# Tools Used:
* D3 library
* Plotly.js
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* GitHub

# What I Learned:
I learned how to use D3 library and Plotly.js to create interactive data visualizations, how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a dashboard, and how to deploy a static web page using GitHub Pages.

# Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project was a great opportunity to learn about data visualization and dashboard building. I gained valuable experience using D3 library and Plotly.js, which I can apply to future data visualization projects. The final product is an interactive dashboard that displays the top 10 OTUs found in an individual's belly button, a bubble chart that displays each sample, and the sample metadata.
